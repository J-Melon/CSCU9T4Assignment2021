# CSCU9T4 Assignment 2021
This is my T4 assignment. It includes everything but exporting to XML.

## Usage
- *Adding*
    - To *add* a new reference select the reference type from the dropdown and fill out __all fields__ available
      (except CSV Path).
        - __Authors__: Enter __Firstname Lastname__ ended with a comma (not on last name) Example: "Christopher Eccleston,
          David Tennant, Matt Smith".
- *Lookup* searches added references with a search parameter depending on what reference type is selected:
    - Journal - Enter __journal name__.
    - Conference - Enter __venue__.
    - Any - Enter __publisher__.
- *Import CSV*
    - Enter __CSV path__.
    - If CSV is formatted to handle all reference types in one file, check __'All reference types?'__ box.
    - If CSV is formatted to handle singular reference types, __adjust dropdown list__ accordingly.
- *Exporting*
    - The results of any lookup search can be exported to a text file by checking the box __'Export search to TXT?'__
      before hitting lookup.
    - __'Export all to TXT'__ needs only the references added to the application, no other input is required.

All output is ordered by the first author starting from Firstname.
